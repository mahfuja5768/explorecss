      Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning. Afternoon or evening
      papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office
      workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a
      morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on
      the night before its cover date, further editions being printed and
      distributed during the night. The later editions can include breaking news
      which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already
      printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late
      night news programs, such as News-night in the United Kingdom. In 1650, the
      first daily newspaper appeared, Einkommende Zeitung,[37] published by
      Timotheus Ritzsch in Leipzig, Germany.[38]

      <strong style="font-size: 20px">A daily newspaper</strong> is printed
      every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally
      <b>Saturdays</b> (and some major holidays).[note 1] Saturday and, where
      they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include
      more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and
      advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these
      newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday
      editions largely depend on content made in advance or content that is
      syndicated.

      General newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at
      least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of
      international events of importance; others might concentrate more on
      national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might
      concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There
      are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports,
      horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called
      newspapers.
